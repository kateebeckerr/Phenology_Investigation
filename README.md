About: 
Phenology can be described as the study of cyclic and seasonal natural phenomena particulary in relation to climate, plant life, and animal life. The blooming of spring flowers, the changing color of leaves, and the migration of birds moving south for the winter are just a few examples showcasing phenology at play. Applications can include: the management of invasive species, the optimiazation of fertilizing, planting, and the harvesting of crops. understanding the timing of ecosystem processes, such as carbon cycling, and the assessment of the vulnerability of species, populations, and ecological communities to ongoing climate change. In this analysis we will focus on the last concept, studying the shifts in phenology to better understand how and if ecosystems are adjusting to climate change.

# Motivation for Study
Using phenology as a metric to understand the causes and effects of climate change 

# Highlights of Workflow
- Employing landsat data 
- Creating an NDVI function
- Raster manipulation 
- Map making
